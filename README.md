# Hospital-ER-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Overview
This project leverages Power BI to analyze patient trends in a hospital, providing data-driven insights to optimize operations and enhance patient satisfaction. The interactive dashboard visualizes key metrics, enabling better decision-making for improved healthcare services.

# Process
- Import Data – Load dataset from CSV files into Power BI.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation – Handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and structural adjustments to ensure data accuracy.
- Visualization & Insights – Create interactive charts, tables, and graphs to highlight key trends and patterns.

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of patient trends from 2019 to 2020, offering key insights into total patient count, satisfaction scores, and waiting times.

Key Findings:
- Overall Growth: The total number of patients increased significantly by 44% in 2020 compared to 2019. This growth correlates with a rise in average satisfaction scores and waiting times, indicating higher demand for healthcare services.

- Weekly Trends: Patient visits peak on Mondays and weekends, suggesting increased demand at the start and end of the week, possibly due to work schedules or delayed weekend consultations.

- Department Distribution: A significant proportion of patients are not assigned to specific departments, while the Renal department has the lowest patient count, highlighting potential resource allocation differences.

- Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Staff: The percentage of administrative and non-administrative staff is nearly equal, suggesting a balanced workforce distribution that supports both operational efficiency and patient care.
- Conclusion:
The 44% increase in patient volume in 2020 reflects a higher demand for healthcare services, leading to longer wait times but also improved satisfaction scores. Mondays and weekends see the highest patient visits, indicating the need for better scheduling and resource management. A large portion of patients remain unassigned to departments, while the Renal department has the lowest patient count, highlighting potential resource allocation inefficiencies. The nearly equal distribution of administrative and non-administrative staff supports operational balance, but further optimization could enhance efficiency and patient care.

The dashboard analyzes patient satisfaction trends, highlighting key insights into ratings, waiting times, and department performance.

Key Findings:
- Overall Satisfaction & Ratings: The average satisfaction score is 5.47, with 27.31% of patients providing ratings while 72.69% did not, indicating potential gaps in feedback collection.
- Trends Over Time: Satisfaction scores fluctuated over two years, peaking in March (5.93) and dropping to 5.30 in December, suggesting seasonal variations or service inconsistencies.
- Age & Demographic Insights: Patients aged 70+ reported lower satisfaction than younger groups, likely due to longer average waiting times. Additionally, Native American/Alaska Native patients experienced the longest wait times, which may contribute to their lower ratings.
- Department Performance:
Cardiology had the highest satisfaction score (7.60) with a moderate waiting time (36.41 mins).
Renal had both the lowest satisfaction score (3.8) and shortest waiting time (32.67 mins), suggesting factors beyond wait times influence satisfaction.
- Conclusion:
High waiting time is not the sole factor affecting satisfaction, indicating that staff interaction, quality of care, and facility conditions may play a role. Future analyses should explore patient feedback, service quality, and communication effectiveness to enhance overall experience.
